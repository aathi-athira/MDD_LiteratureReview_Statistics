## 1. Omics

### Genomics

- Studies genetic factors, gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromosomal relations in MDD.
- Focuses on inherited and environmental influences on gene activity and MDD risk.

### Proteomics

- Analyzes proteins, neurohormones, and inflammatory markers in blood, serum, and plasma.
- Highlights differences in protein expression and immune response in MDD patients.

### Metabolomics

- Examines metabolites, gut microbiota, and the gut-brain axis.
- Explores how diet, microbiome composition, and metabolic pathways are altered in MDD.

### Pharmacology

- Applies omics findings to drug response and treatment.
- Discusses antidepressant effectiveness, pharmacogenetics (e.g., CYP genotyping), side effects, and alternative therapies.

## 2. Neuroimaging

### EEG (Electroencephalography)

- Measures electrical brain activity to assess functional changes, treatment effects, and biomarkers in MDD.

### NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)

- Assesses blood oxygenation and metabolic activity in the brain, used for screening cognitive deficits and differentiating MDD.

### MRI/fMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Functional MRI)

- Provides detailed images of brain structure, connectivity, and function.
- Identifies changes in brain regions (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus, default mode network) associated with MDD.
- ML (machine learning) is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Other Modalities (e.g., DTI)

- Includes electroretinogram, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and multi-modal imaging.

---

## 3. Auxiliary

### Scales/Questionnaires

- Tools for assessing symptom severity, diagnosis, and treatment response (e.g., DSM-5, MINI, Beck Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, PHQ-9).

### Digital Tools/Apps

- Use of apps, web platforms, and electronic measurement-based care (MBC) for self-reporting, monitoring, and remote therapy.

### Therapy/Counseling

- Includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psycho-therapeutic approaches, and speech recognition for noninvasive assessment.

### ML/AI, Robotics

- ML for psychodiagnostics, robotics for interviews, and network analysis for understanding symptom interconnections.

---

## 4. Discussion

- The review covers all major MDD assessment fields and tools.
- MDD is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, age, and family history.
- Proteomics and metabolomics provide insight but not causality.
- Neuroimaging, especially MRI with ML, is the most promising for clinical practice.
- Auxiliary tools are useful but mainly complementary.
- Ethnicity, economic status, and individual adaptability affect findings.

---

## 5. Limitations

- Only English research articles were included; other types and older studies may have been missed.
- Recent trends may bias findings.
- The review is general and may need future updates for more depth.

---

## 6. Conclusions and Future Directions

- ML-assisted neuroimaging (MRI) is currently the most suitable clinical assessment tool for MDD.
- Early diagnosis of MDD is becoming more feasible with multi-modal approaches.
- Combining data from multiple assessment fields (omics, neuroimaging, digital tools) is recommended for better diagnosis and treatment.
- The review encourages considering the well-being of healthcare professionals in MDD management.
